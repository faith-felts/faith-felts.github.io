    <p>I am a sophomore at Arizona Christian University. I am a Christian and regularly attend a church in Chandler. I enjoy working with my hands, hiking, playing games, and playing piano. I currently work as an entry-level UI developer, but I have a lot left to learn.</p>
 
    <h3>Mmmm... Green Chili</h3>
    <p>I love to cook when I travel back home from college. I am Cajun, so my obvious favorite cuisine to cook is Cajun food. As of late, I have gotten my family (and boyfriend) hooked on Green Chili, Shrimp Etouffee, and Gumbo. I feel like I can't whip out batches of roux fast enough! Cooking helps me feel connected to my ancestors by making their recipes and helps me serve my current family. Honestly, nothing says "I love you" like a po' boy sandwich on a summer day.</p>
